          Bruce Forey is recognized as a dynamic and accomplished marketing and communications professional. He offers a
          track record within the broadband industry for developing and deploying strategic marketing plans, designing
          and launching effective PR campaigns, and delivering communications initiatives that drive brand awareness,
          boost sales, and advance the organizational mission. Before establishing the Broadmax Group, Forey served 12
          years at utility broadband cooperatives establishing marketing and communications departments. <br>

          At GVTC Communications, Forey led the company’s first communications department organized to support fiber
          broadband and other business operations. He developed a campaign to educate members, community leaders,
          employees and the media about the many benefits of fiber broadband compared to older technologies. This
          strategy led to increased brand awareness that helped GVTC successfully compete against Fortune 50 internet
          providers for customers. Forey also collaborated closely with executive management to shape and deliver
          strategic messaging for the company’s annual meetings and employee town halls. In addition, He led the company
          into social media and guided GVTC’s entry into digital advertising which contributed to a 30% increase in
          broadband sales during its first year of activity. He also served as an eight-year board member for The GVTC
          Foundation directing an awareness drive that contributed to the nonprofit’s significant growth in
          contributions and giving.

          At Bandera Electric Cooperative, Forey quickly retooled the company’s public relations department into a
          highly effective marketing and communications organization to promote awareness and generate sales for the
          company’s entry into fiber broadband and solar system sales. Forey realigned the brands of the fiber and solar
          operations to leverage the established BEC brand in the community. He led a market analysis that shaped the
          fiber broadband and solar marketing and communications strategy. Within weeks, the company met or surpassed
          projections for leads and sales for the fiber broadband and solar products. The marketing strategy also led to
          the company achieving year end revenue goals months ahead of schedule. During this time, Forey led the
          complete redesign of the BEC’s website with an updated look and to facilitate leads and online orders. Forey
          also leveraged his nonprofit board experience to lead the reorganizion of BEC’s nonprofit foundation to better
          serve the needs of the community.
