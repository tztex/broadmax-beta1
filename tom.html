            Bruce Forey is recognized as a dynamic and accomplished marketing and communications professional. He offers
            a
            track record within the broadband industry for developing and deploying strategic marketing plans, designing
            and launching effective PR campaigns, and delivering communications initiatives that drive brand awareness,
            boost sales, and advance the organizational mission. Before establishing the Broadmax Group, Forey served 12
            years at utility broadband cooperatives establishing marketing and communications departments. <br>

            At GVTC Communications, Forey led the company’s first communications department organized to support fiber
            broadband and other business operations. He developed a campaign to educate members, community leaders,
            employees and the media about the many benefits of fiber broadband compared to older technologies. This
            strategy led to increased brand awareness that helped GVTC successfully compete against Fortune 50 internet
            providers for customers. Forey also collaborated closely with executive management to shape and deliver
            strategic messaging for the company’s annual meetings and employee town halls. In addition, He led the
            company
            into social media and guided GVTC’s entry into digital advertising which contributed to a 30% increase in
            broadband sales during its first year of activity. He also served as an eight-year board member for The GVTC
            Foundation directing an awareness drive that contributed to the nonprofit’s significant growth in
            contributions and giving.

            American Marketing Association. His community involvement also includes the Society of St. Vincent de Paul
            and
